# Constructive definition

Consider a Dirichlet Process (DP) with *concentration parameter* $\alpha$ and *baseline distribution* $G_0$.

Let $z_1,z_2,\ldots$ and $\vartheta_1,\vartheta_2.\ldots$ are independent sequences of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables such that
$$
z_r\sim\textsf{Beta}(1,\alpha)\,,\quad r=1,2,\ldots
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\vartheta_\ell\sim G_0\,,\quad \ell=1,2,\ldots
$$

According to the **constructive definition** of the DP, a realization $G$ from $\textsf{DP}(\alpha,G_0)$ is given by
$$
G(\cdot) = \sum_{\ell=1}^\infty \omega_\ell\,\delta_{\vartheta_\ell}(\cdot)
$$
where:

- $\omega_1,\omega_2,\ldots$ are such that $\omega_1 = z_1$ and $\omega_\ell = z_\ell\prod_{r=1}^{\ell-1}(1-z_r)$, for $\ell=2,3,\ldots$, which is known as **stick-breaking process**.
- $\delta_a(\cdot)$ is the distribution function of a point mass at $a$.


# Stick-breaking process

It stick-breaking process provides a way to understand the infinite-dimensional nature of the DP, by generating a **sequence of weights** $\omega_1,\omega_2,\ldots$ of a discrete probability distribution.

- Start with a stick of length 1 representing the total probability to be distributed among the $\vartheta_1,\vartheta_2,\ldots$

- $z_1$ is the portion of the original stick assigned to $\vartheta_1$, so that $\omega_1 = z_1$.

     The remaining part of the stick has length $1-z_1$.
     
- $z_2$ is the portion of the remaining stick assigned to $\vartheta_2$, so that $\omega_2 = z_2(1-z_1)$. 
          
     The remaining part of the stick has length $(1-z_1)(1-z_2)$.
     
- Continue breaking.

Under this setup, we say that $\omega_1,\omega_2,\ldots\textsf{SB}(\alpha)$. 

It can be shown that $\sum_{\ell=1}^\infty \omega_\ell = 1$.

# Countable mixtures of point masses

The DP generates distributions that can be represented as **countable mixtures of point masses**.

As a matter of fact, **any distribution** on $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be approximated arbitrarily well using a countable mixture of point masses.

The constructive definition points out to the fact that the DP generates discrete distributions.


# Simulation

The DP constructive definition yields another method to simulate from the DP up to a truncation approximation:
$$
G(\cdot) \approx \sum_{\ell=1}^J p_\ell\,\delta_{\vartheta_\ell}(\cdot)\,,
$$
where $p_\ell = \omega_\ell$, for $\ell=1,\ldots,J$, and $p_J = 1 - \sum_{\ell=1}^{J-1} p_\ell$.

It can be shown that
$$
\textsf{E}\left( \sum_{\ell=1}^{J} \omega_\ell\right) = 1 - \left( \frac{\alpha}{\alpha+1} \right)^J\,.
$$
Thus, $J$ can be chosen such that $(\alpha/(\alpha+1))^J=\epsilon$, for small $\epsilon$, i.e., $J=\log(\epsilon)/\log(\alpha/(\alpha+1))$.

The following correspond to a realization from a $\textsf{DP}(\alpha, G_0$), for $\alpha= 25$ and $G_0 = \textsf{N}(0,1)$. The solid black line corresponds to $G_0$, while the blue line represents the corresponding realization.

In the left panel, the spiked lines are located at 1000 draws from $G_0$ with heights given by the (truncated) stick-breaking weights. These spikes are then summed up to generate a sample path.

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=7, fig.align='center'}
# simulation of several G such that G ~ DP(alpha = 25, G_0 = N(0,1))
# using the constructive definition of the DP
alpha <- 25
eps <- 1e-6
J <- round(log(eps)/log(alpha/(alpha+1)))
G0 <- function(x) pnorm(x)
set.seed(1)
vartheta <- rnorm(n = J)
z <- rbeta(n = J, shape1 = 1, shape2 = alpha)

omega[1] <- z[1]
for (j in 2:(J-1))
  omega[j] <- z[j]*prod(1 - z[1:(j-1)])

x <- seq(from = -3, to = 3, len = 1000)
G <- NULL
for (j in 1:length(x))
  G[j] <- sum(omega[vartheta <= x[j]])
plot(x = x, y = G, type = "l", xlim = c(-3,3), col = 4)
curve(expr = G0(x), from = -3, to = 3, n = 1000, lwd = 2, add = TRUE)
